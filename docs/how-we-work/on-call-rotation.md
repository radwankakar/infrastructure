# On Call Rotation Policy

This documents the OHS Hosting team's on-call rotation policy describing who is on-call and what their responsibilities are.

## Responsibilities

### On Call Responder
The responsibility of the on-call responder is to monitor the reporting channels (documented in the how-we-work/support-process.md) to watch for any issues reported by the app teams.

If any issue is reported or detected, the on-call responder will start working through the Incident Response plan documented in how-we-work/support-process.md

### On Call Communicator

The on-call communicator is the person that will be on-call responder in two weeks. Once an issue is verified as actual, the on-call responder will engage with the on-call communicator to contruct notifications to the relevant groups depending on situation. There will be templates for these notifications.

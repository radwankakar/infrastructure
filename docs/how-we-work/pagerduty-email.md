# In Case of a Site Outage

If you notice a consistent issue with a site/service that is resulting in an outage, the best way to notify the on-call Hosting team member is by shooting a detailed e-mail to the [Pagerduty email](mailto:R016TZAS8T9C9J1MCG4715BTR0O59NMR@headstarthosting.pagerduty.com). This will alert the on-call team member, and begin the process of debugging the issue. 
Please only use the above method for issues that are resulting in an inability for users to access a site/service. All other issues should be submitted through the previously established channels.

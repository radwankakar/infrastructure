# Head Start Coaching Companion (HSCC) Integrations

## Background

As part of understanding the current system, we need to document all the current integrations and applications that are functional on the system so that we can include them when considering design, implementation, and migration to the new system. This will also help us when it comes to evaluating applications suitability for Cloud.gov.

## Integrations

- Vimeo
  - Uses Vimeo API to upload videos and then to view in browser
- Google analytics (not confirmed)
- Smartsheets

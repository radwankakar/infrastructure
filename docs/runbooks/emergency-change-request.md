# How to request an emergency change request

__Last updated by Eady on April 22, 2021.__

If a system in the Headstart Hosting account requires an change outside of a regular maitenence window, the Dev team and Hosting team need to plan the operation and submit an emergency change request form.

__Note:__ As we make more an more of these operations automated we will evaluate the utility and speed of this process with customers and key stakeholders.

## Step 0: Evaluate the need for an off-cycle change

Is there an active ongoing incident? (Are users unable to access sites? Is performance siginificantly degraded?)

If "yes": please proceed.

Does this change address immediate security or quality needs of the application?

If "yes": please proceed.

If "no": please notify the Headstart hosting team anyways, we will work on a plan for deployment in the coming month.

## Step 1: Notify and Define operation(s)

__Please notify Hosting team as soon as possible this will give us time to write the CR form and submit to Elizabeth and Alana ASAP for review.__

1. Notify the Headstart Hosting team that a change needs to be made and the nature of the change.
1. Document step by step the changes needed to be made and share with Hosting team.

## Step 2: Validate changes necessary in Staging

__Note:__ The Development team should have access to make changes in staging but may require the assistance of the Headstart Hosting team.

1. Make required changes in staging.
    * If the Dev team requires assistance from the Hosting team, please let us know and we will schedule a video chat/screenshare within 2 hours.
    * Please try to use documented operations defined in Step 1 as it will be more repeatable in Step 5.
1. Have QA/Testers/Dev/Product validate changes in staging environment.
1. Adjust step-by-step operation plan.

## Step 3: Fill out the emergency change request form

1. Fill out the form.

TODOS: Add links to forms to use and any notes or clarifications.

## Step 4 Have CR form reviewed, approved, then submitted

1. Hosting team evaluates the submitted form for security or performance risks and makes adjustments to operation plan.
1. Headstart hosting team will submit the emergency change request form to Elizabeth and Alana for approval. CC the dev/affected teams.
    * If one of the CORs is out of office, approval of just one will suffice.
    * If the emergency change is related to a security fix/incident, CC our ACF OCIO ISSO.
1. Save a copy of the form to the ECLKC Box folder.

## Step 5: Apply changes to production

1. Hosting team will apply changes using documented and outlined steps shared with teams involved.
    * Development team will be on standby to assist in validation of application of changes.
1. Once operations are complete, Developmeent team validates application of changes to production.
1. Development team validates application of changes to production, the Hosting team will send notice to stakeholders.

# How to create an ECLKC login

There are three different environments to create accounts on: Dev, Staging, Production.

1. Go to the appropriate page for the environment you are creating an account for:
   - [ECLKC Dev login](https://eclkcdev.eclkc.info/cas/login)
   - [ECLKC Staging login](https://stage.eclkc.info/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fstage.eclkc.info%2F&locale=en)
   - [ECLKC Prod login](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Feclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov%2F&locale=en)
1. Click the large "REGISTER NOW" button midway down the page.
1. Enter in a username and your email address then click the "Submit" button.
1. Within a few minutes, you will receive an email titled `Your Early Childhood Learning and Knowledge Center user ID for your new Account` from `no_reply@eclkc.info`.
   The email contains a link to complete your registration.
   Follow that link in your browser.
1. Fill out your name, password, and security question then click the "Register" button.
   Please save your password and security information in a secure application such as 1Password.
1. You will then be directed to a new site to configure your 2FA.
   We recommend using an application such as 1Password or Authy since this can be synced across multiple phones, iPads, and local applications.
1. Please test your login.

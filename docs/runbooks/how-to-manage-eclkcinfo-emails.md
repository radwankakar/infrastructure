# How to manage ECLKC.info emails

## Adding emails to aliases

0. Login to the vpn.
1. Navigate your browser to: [iRedAdmin](https://10.2.0.10/iredadmin/login). Note this does not have a certificate, you'll have to bypass your browser's security block on the site.
2. Login using the username `postmaster@eclkc.info` with the password in the Keypass database. (TODO: Move these to a better spot so you don't need to send this file around.)
3. Navigate to the eclkc.info domain by clicking "Domains and Accounts" in the navigation bar and selecting the "eclkc.info" domain from the list.
4. Select the alias you wish to edit from the list.
5. In the "Members" field in the configuration screen for the selected alias, add or remove email addressess as appropriate.

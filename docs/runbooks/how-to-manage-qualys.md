# How to manage Qualys

Qualys is a 3rd party website scanning tool.
This allows the OHS hosting team to run high quality security scans against the ECLKC envrionment without waiting on cycles from ACF OCIO.

## Adding a new user to Qualys

1. Login to the [Qualys Web portal](https://qualysguard.qg3.apps.qualys.com/portal-front/).
2. From the "Modules" drop down menu, select "Utilities: Administration".
3. Click the dropdown button labelled "Create User" and select "Create Manager User".
4. This opens a popup where you'll enter in their name and email address. The other fields can be changed by the user later. Click "Save". The user should receive an email with a sign up link. Note the url in the email is only good for 24 hours.
5. Notify the user and ask them to go through the signup process and confirm with you they have access.

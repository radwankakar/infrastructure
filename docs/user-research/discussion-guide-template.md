## Methodology

This is the interview/research method you are using during this session.

* In-person contextual inquiry
* 1 hour usability test

## Introductions

Use this section for:

* Introducing yourself and the team that is participating in the research session/interview.
* Give a brief overview of the projects goals/objectives.
* Confirm the length of the interview and the approximate shape of it. (Work out any screen sharing or other requirements here.)
* Ask permission to record the session.

Example of how to ask recording permission:

```txt
Thank you for joining us today. We will use the information we gain from this conversation to better understand your role and the challenges you face as part of the Managed Care process. The information you provide will help us fill in gaps in our own knowledge of the process so that we can build a product that meets your needs.

If you consent, we would like to record this session for our internal team.

[If they say no] Since you do not feel comfortable being recorded, can we please take notes during this session so that we have a log of our conversation?

Before we begin, I want to make sure you know to speak openly and honestly: we are interested in your perspective so do not worry about representing the opinions of anyone else. If you would like to say something off the record, please let us know and we will stop the recording and / or make a note of it so that off the record information does not get shared publicly. Also, if there are any questions you do not know or cannot answer, that is perfectly fine.

Any questions? Let’s begin! [start recording]
```

## Interview questions

In this section you will outline your interview questions. Typically the interview questions are grouped into sections of related questions. Try to prioritize your interview questions based on what information you feel you need to get out of the interview.

It’s also good to help an interviewee warm up first. Think about including some lower load questions like “tell me about your background/role” before diving into more in-depth questioning.

It may also be helpful to put time limits on sections of your interview. This will help you make sure that you’ll get through certain questions before running out of time with the interviewee.

## Conclusion

Closing questions help your conversation naturally progress to an end, while also helping your team identify next steps.

Some sample questions:

* Is there anything else you think we’ve missed?
* Who do you recommend we speak to next?
* Do you have any questions for us?

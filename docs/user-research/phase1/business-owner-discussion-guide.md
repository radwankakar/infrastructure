# Head Start Business Owners discussion guide

## Introduction 
```Hi. Thank you for your time today. My name is [name]  and I’m a designer on the Head Start Hosting and Infrastructure project. I want to make sure I’m pronouncing your name correctly, Is it ________? Thank you!

I’d like to give you a little bit of background on what we’re doing today…but before that, how much do you know about Head Start and our project?

Truss is here to help the office of headstart move into a more devops way of working. So we are spending some time understanding their current way of working to help inform what that new world might look like.

With that in mind, I’d like to spend the next roughly 60 minutes learning your role, your workflow, what works well, what is challenging etc. This will give our team the foundational understanding before we start suggesting improvements or designing.

In our chat today, I’d love for you to speak openly and honestly with us. There are no right or wrong answers. We are interested in your specific perspective and experiences. 

Are we okay to record this session for our internal team? This will let us focus on listening to you instead of trying to take a lot of notes. Is that okay? If you would like to say something off the record, please let us know and we will stop the recording and / or make a note of it so that off the record information does not get shared publicly. Also, if there are any questions you do not know or cannot answer, that is perfectly fine, just let us know.
```
Make sure to claim host [Record] 

[If they say no] Since you do not feel comfortable being recorded, can we please take notes during this session so that we have a log of our conversation?
```
Do you have any questions before we begin?

## Goals
* Identify what Business Owners care about from a deployment and maintenance perspective
* Identify what information BO’s have to hand today when it comes to requests so that we can make future ones more outcome oriented.
* Describe their familiarity with the ATO process so that we can support them in their future ones. 

## Questions
### Your role
* Could you tell me a bit about your role on the team?
* What are your primary responsibilities when it comes to your team?
   * Are you in any way involved in deployment activities?

### Current deployment experience
* What are your thoughts on your current deployment process?
   * What specifically is challenging from your perspective?
   * If you had to change this, how would you like it work? Why?
* We know that teams need to provide notice of specific changes in a deployment. We know that there’s a process to this. What are your thoughts on how it works?
   * What specifically is challenging about it?
   * If you had to change this, how would you like it work? Why?

### Measuring success
* Let’s say a deployment happens, what does success look like for you in your role?
* What do you look for in the app or outside to get that indication?

### Manage their requests
* Could you tell me about the last request you made to the Truss team? 
* How much information did you have to hand when you made that request?
* Were there any constraints you were working within? E.g. deadlines, strategic initiatives, downstream dependencies
* How do you feel about writing requests that are focussed on outcomes and less about implementation?

### Going through the ATO process
* What’s your familiarity with going through the ATO process?
If none, end
If yes,
   * What’s your experience been like?
   * What areas were the most challenging to you?
* How do you feel about going through an ATO in the future for your own application?
* How do you see the Truss team’s involvement in a future ATO?

### Switch to a new way of working
As you know, we’re working with OHS to make changes to how you develop and deploy software. We want to understand where we can support you and guide you with this change in process.

* What are your thoughts about switching to a devops way of releasing software?
* What areas do you have concerns about?
* How equipped do you think the team will be? 
   * Are there any gaps that exist?

### Upcoming priorities
As you know, we are working on a new devops process with changes to infrastructure. What we want to do is make sure we don’t lose sight of any other priorities you may have as a BO for this app. 

With that in mind, I’m curious, what strategic priorities do you have in the next 6 months to 1 year that might influence the Truss team’s priorities or work load?
* Are there any must-dos?

### Wrap up
* What about your app’s current hosting infrastructure is difficult?
   * How does that make a part of your role challenging?
* Is there anything else you think we’ve missed?
* Do you have any questions for us?

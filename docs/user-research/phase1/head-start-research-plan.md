# Head Start Research Plan

## Background

Truss is working with Head Start to move them into the world of Devops. The team is in the design phase right now making choices on how the new CI/CD process would work. They need to make choices that will make sure the new process works for applications teams who are the end users.

## Goals for Dev teams

- Understand what, why, and type of system access developers need to best develop, deploy, and maintain their applications on our system
  - Identify their current painpoints
- Describe the current development and deployment process for their applications
  - Identify their current painpoints especially once code is written. E.g. testing, deploying, tools involved etc.

## Goals for Business Owners

- Identify what Business Owners care about from a deployment and maintenance perspective
- Identify what information BO’s have to hand today when it comes to requests so that we can make future ones more outcome oriented.
- Describe their familiarity with the ATO process so that we can support them in their future ones.

_Not for now: We want to get early feedback on the proposed CI/CD process we are thinking of. Identify any gaps or challenges that we need to address._

## Research Questions

[Initial brainstorming](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lL_TCxY=/)

- What is the current development and deployment process for various teams?
- Why is the current process the way it is? What goals do they support? Why is the most feasible solution?
- What parts of it are challenging?
- What is their current process for testing?
- What would the ideal process look like?
- What would a good developer environment look like?
- What parts of their own system don’t developers know about?
- How do dev teams keep up with ATO compliance requirements?

Hi \[name\],
It’s great to connect with you.

I’m \[name\], a member of the Truss team that is working with the Office of Head Start to follow compliant, Devops best practices.

We are looking to better understand how your development and deployment  currently works within your team so that we can make sure the new process meets your expectations.

To do that, we’d love to spend a 60 minute 1:1 session next week (9/20 -9/23) Mon-Thu to hear your experiences. The session will take place over zoom and there’s no need to prepare. We won’t be using any additional documents or materials during our conversation.

Could you send two to three 60 minute slots that work best with your schedule?

Also, once we do schedule you in, if things do change, please don’t feel pressured to commit and stick it. We can most certainly reschedule.

We thank you for your help.

Best,

# User Interviews

## Intro

Thank you for joining us today. My name is XXX and I’m an XXX \[add your name and position\] for Truss Works. We’re contracting with OHS to help manage and configure infrastructure for the apps under the OHS umbrella, support automation where possible, and to engender an internal devsecops community of practice--essentially, building security, infrastructure, and operations concerns into your apps as part of development. We wanted to have a conversation with you today to better understand your role, the challenges you face, and your experiences with current tools, as well as your day-to-day work. The information you provide will inform what we may build.

Before we begin, I’d like to take a moment for the rest of my team to quickly introduce themselves… \[beach ball to each other: name, role @Truss, and why you’re here (taking notes, etc.)\]

With your approval, we would like to record this session for research purposes.

\[If they say no\] Ok, no problem. Since you’re not comfortable being recorded, can we please take notes during this session so that we have a log of our conversation? \[Team switches to recording direct quotes of interest rather than implicit observations\]

Before we begin, I want to make sure you know to speak openly and honestly: we are interested in your personal perspective so do not worry about representing the opinions of anyone else. If you would like to say something off the record, please let us know and we will stop the recording. Also, if there are any questions you do not know or cannot answer, that is perfectly fine.

Any questions? Let’s begin! \[start recording\]

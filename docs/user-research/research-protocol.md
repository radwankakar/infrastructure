# Research Protocol

DRAFT - last updated by Eady 04/13/2021

## Purpose

This protocol is to help us plan:

- Preparing for research sessions
- Handling data post-research sessions

## Mindset

TODO: Add here

### Tips

- Make questions situational. ex: "When you arrived" questions.
- Instead of "Why?" ask "Tell me more about that." or "How did you make that decision?"
- Ask open-ended questions. You want to get your interviewee to tell you their story.
- You can always ask follow up questions.
- You cannot ask people to predict anything or remember something too far in the past. Humans are much better at fabricating answers to meet social expectations than truthful ones.

### Background reading on research

Some of these are sources for creating these research documents.

- [Remote research by Monica Finc @ Truss](https://truss.works/blog/research-from-home)
- [Research questions are not interview questions by Erika Hall](https://medium.com/mule-design/research-questions-are-not-interview-questions-7f90602eb533)
- [18F interview checklist](https://methods.18f.gov/interview-checklist/)
- [18F Research planning](https://ux-guide.18f.gov/research/do/)

## Protocol

### Step 1: Schedule research session

1. Compile and prepare Truss team availability for the next week.
1. Work with interviewees to fit with
   - We may have notes on some folks timezones and availability.
1. Create calendar invite to interviewee and Truss team.
   - Add Zoomgov link.
   - Re-confirm time as necessary.
   - Make sure to also invite headstart-hosting@truss.works just to confirm it shows up on people's personal calendars
1. Set up 15-20min prep meeting before the session to go over the plan.
1. Set up 15-30min post session meeting after interview to perform follow up actions.

### Step 2: Create a discussion guide

We will write a discussion guide rather than an interview "script".
You may strike upon a tangential topic that may provide context and insight into the original goals of the research.

Please use the [Discussion Guide Template](./discussion-guide-template.md) as a starting place.

1. Identify goals of the research session and determine the things you would like to learn.
1. Draft a list of questions as the discussion guide.
1. Review some of the tips we've gathered in background reading to help rewrite or reframe these questions and what we shouldn't be asking.
1. Have the team and our UX experts review the questions for things we've missed or leading questions.
1. Save a copy of the discussion guide.
1. Save it to the an appropriate shared folder with a new copy for the person interviewed.
1. Share the discussion guide to the channel so others can add questions, etc.
   - It may be helpful to take some of a collab session to brainstorm/build the interview script with the team.
   - You may have specific questions for a specific interviewee.
1. Create a new data entry in Dovetail for the interview and attach the discussion guide.
1. Attach the discussion guide to interview prep calendar event.

### Step 3: Identify note takers

- It’s preferable to have two note takers for each session.
- Note takers should focus on identifying important quotes we’ll want to be sure to highlight:
  - new information we haven’t heard before
  - new questions that we have based on what we’re hearing
- Verbatim notes aren’t required if the meeting is being recorded.

### Step 4: Perform the research session

#### Record the research session (if given permission)

We should always try to record interviews but must get permission from the interviewees before recording. Please see the [introductions section](./discussion-guide-template.md#Introductions)in the Discussion Guide template for example language.

### Step 5: After the session

Please complete the following within 48hr of the interview.

1. Obtain audio/video file from ZoomGov
1. Save to the google drive folder (maybe box?) for that interview (ex. Interviews > Name_Date) Saving to the cloud works.
1. Upload into Dovetail for transcription
1. Review and tag the interview transcription
   Note: It’s helpful to do this right after the interview for some folks, so block out your time according.
1. Let the channel know once the interview has been transcribed and tagged and ask for someone to review your work
   Also alert people if you have added new tags.
1. Gather any AIs and assign them to the proper person/workstream.
1. See learnings on Dovetail.
1. Share out preliminary findings.
